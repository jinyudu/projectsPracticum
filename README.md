# projectsPracticum
This repo contains projects for the Practicum bootcamp.

# The table below lists the names and brief description of the projects.

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | User music preferences | This project compares the music preferences and user behavior of the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville using hypotheses testing. |
| 2 | Evaluate loan default risks | This project aims to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children have an impact on whether they will default on a loan. |
| 3 | Determine factors that influence the price of vehicles | This project determines factors that influence the price of  vehicles by analyzing free advertisements for vehicles published on websites. |
| 4 | Which prepaid plans bring in more revenue? | This project wants to know which of the two prepaid plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. |
| 5 (Integrated Project 1) | What makes a game succeed? | In this project, we want to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow us to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. |
| 6 | Understand passenger preferences | In this project, we'll analyze data from ride-sharing companies to understand passenger preferences. We will also test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency. |
| 7 | Develop a classification model to analyze Mobile subscribers' behavior | By analyzing behavior data about subscribers who have already switched from legacy plans to the new plans, we want to develop a classification model for picking the right plan for Mobile subscribers. |
| 8 | Predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon | To find ways to save the existing customers, we need to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon, by analyzing the data on clients’ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. |
| 9 | Pick the best place for a new oil well | We have data on oil samples from three regions. Parameters of each oil well in the region are already known. We want to build a model that helps to pick the region with the highest profit margin. We will analyze the potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique. |
| 10 (Integrated Project 2) | Predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore | In this project, we want to build a model that will predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters. |
| 11 | Making predictions for Sure Tomorrow insurance company | In this model, we want to solve four major tasks for the insurance company with the help of machine learning. Data obfuscation is used to proect personal information. |
| 12 | Machine learning models for car valuation | In this project, we want to determine the value of cars by training different models with various hyperparameters. We are particularly interested in comparing the quality and speed of the prediction. |
